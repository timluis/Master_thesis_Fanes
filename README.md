# Hydrogeology in the are of Lake Limo, Dolomites

I've written this code for my master thesis at the University of Innsbruck. It is my first experience with programming, so there might be room to improve in terms of style and simplifications. It's useable to download and save meteorological data from the [Open Data Portal Bozen](https://data.civis.bz.it/de/dataset/1512fa49-3e97-40d7-9bdb-2fc76c9efe3c/resource/9ca68cd2-2060-4a02-8a04-09b9d4acac40/download/dokumentationopendatameteode.pdf) to an SQLite database. Further on, it's able to process the metrological data and create plots for the thesis. 

As the database is larger than 100 Mb it needs to be rebuilt if you're using this code locally. Use this [notebook]() to rebuild it.
